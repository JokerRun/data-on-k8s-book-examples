# Deploying MySQL Example - Data on Kubernetes the Hard Way

This example shows how to deploy MySQL on Kubernetes, starting from a simple Kubernetes cluster.

This is a code example for the O'Reilly book [Managing Cloud-Native Data on Kubernetes](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-cloud-native/9781098111380/).

This example was inspired by the [Wordpress and MySQL tutorial](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/mysql-wordpress-persistent-volume/) in the Kubernetes documentation.
