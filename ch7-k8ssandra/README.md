# K8ssandra Operator Example 

This is a code example for the O'Reilly book [Managing Cloud-Native Data on Kubernetes](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-cloud-native/9781098111380/).

This example shows how to deploy a Cassandra cluster on Kubernetes using the [K8ssandra Operator](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra-operator).

The configuration files used in this example are based on samples from the K8ssandra Operator [Install Guide](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra-operator/blob/main/docs/install/README.md) page. They are reproduced here for the convenience of readers who have cloned this repo in order to work along with examples in the book.
