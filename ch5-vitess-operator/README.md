# Vitess Operator Example 

This is a code example for the O'Reilly book [Managing Cloud-Native Data on Kubernetes](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-cloud-native/9781098111380/).

This example shows how to deploy a MySQL cluster using Vitess on Kubernetes using the [PlanetScale Operator for Vitess](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mysql/).

The configuration files used in this example are a subset of the code used in the [Get Started / Vitess Operator for Kubernetes](https://vitess.io/docs/12.0/get-started/operator/) page. They are reproduced here for the convenience of readers who have cloned this repo in order to work along with examples in the book. Please check the [source repo](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/tree/main/examples/operator) for the latest files.
